# Lightchain Explorer

This project was forked from [ETC Block Explorer Development](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/explorer).

## Installation

### Pre-requirements

Download [Nodejs and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node "Nodejs install") if you don't have them

### Local installation

**Clone Repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/lightstreams-network/lightchain-explorer
```

**Install dependencies**

```
npm install
```

***Install mongodb***

MacOS: `brew install mongodb`

Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org`

### Populate the DB

This will fetch and parse the entire blockchain.

Setup your configuration file: `cp config.example.json config.json`

Edit `config.json` as you wish

Basic settings:
```json
{
    "nodeAddr":     "localhost",
    "gethPort":     8545,
    "tendermintAddr": "127.0.0.1:26657",
    "syncConsensus" : true,
    "startBlock":   0,
    "quiet":        false,
    "syncAll":      true,
    "patch":        true,
    "patchBlocks":  100,
    "bulkSize":     100,

         }
    }
}


```

```nodeAddr```    Your node API RPC address.

```gethPort```    Your node API RPC port.

```startBlock```  This is the start block of the blockchain, should always be 0 if you want to sync the whole ETC blockchain.

```endBlock```    This is usually the 'latest'/'newest' block in the blockchain, this value gets updated automatically, and will be used to patch missing blocks if the whole app goes down.

```quiet```       Suppress some messages. (admittedly still not quiet)

```syncAll```     If this is set to true at the start of the app, the sync will start syncing all blocks from lastSync, and if lastSync is 0 it will start from whatever the endBlock or latest block in the blockchain is.

```patch```       If set to true and below value is set, sync will iterated through the # of blocks specified.

```patchBlocks``` If `patch` is set to true, the amount of block specified will be check from the latest one.


### Run:
The below will start both the web-gui and sync.js (which populates MongoDV with blocks/transactions).
`npm start`

You can leave sync.js running without app.js and it will sync and grab blocks based on config.json parameters
`node ./tools/sync.js`

Enabling stats requires running a separate process:
`node ./tools/stats.js`

You can configure intervals (how often a new data point is pulled) and range (how many blocks to go back) with the following:
`RESCAN=1000:100000 node tools/stats.js` (New data point every 1,000 blocks. Go back 100,000 blocks).

### Clean:
Data is being allocated into a DB names `blockDB` in mongo, just run the following command to wipe it entirely:
```
mongo blockDB --eval "db.dropDatabase();"
```
